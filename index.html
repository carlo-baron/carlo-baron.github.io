        <div class="description">
            <p>
                Mindanao is the second-largest island in the Philippines, after Luzon, and seventh-most populous island in the world. Located in the southern region of the archipelago, the island is part of an island group of the same name that also includes its adjacent islands, notably the Sulu Archipelago. According to the 2020 census, Mindanao has a population of 26,252,442 people, while the entire island group has an estimated population of 27,021,036 according to the 2021 census.

                Mindanao encompasses the large island of Mindanao plus smaller islands in the southern Philippines. In its largest city, Davao, the Philippine Eagle Centre and Davao Crocodile Park showcase local wildlife. The urban People's Park features statues of indigenous people and the Durian Dome, named after the spiky, smelly fruit that grows in abundance on Mindanao. Southwest, the Mount Apo volcano has trails and a lake.
